# stores-snapshot
This snapshot was done to demonstrate an efficient algorithm to find the potential locations for a store in a neighborhood represented by a 2D vector matrix where 1's are houses. Stores can be placed at most K spaces away from houses, and may only be placed in empty spaces. This problem was brought up in a coding interview and I have produced an algorithm to find locations in O(n^2) time and constant space.
